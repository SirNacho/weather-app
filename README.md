# React Weather App
Hi, this is a react weather app I made to test my skills on react as well as using API to display the weather data.
In this project, I learn more about how to use CSS to design the app as well as structuring data and gathering data using API keys to display on the app.
# How to run it
What you need to do is run "yarn start" on the terminal and it will start a local server.

```
$ yarn start
```
Then go to a internet browser of choice and input:

```
localhost:3000
```

Feel free to use this code for other projects.
